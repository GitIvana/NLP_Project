## BERT
test.sh is used to run the bert model you can either use it or do 
```
python pytorchwarmedup.py
```
the textCNN.py contains textCNN model which did not output great result so we are not using it in the end
But you may want to test it by 
```
python textCNN.py
```
read the requirement.txt before you try to run the python script.
